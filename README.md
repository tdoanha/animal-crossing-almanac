# Animal Crossing Almanac

## Description:

This is an almanac website for Animal Crossing New Horizons. It's intended use is to query various items and display relevant information for my own personal gameplay experience. It will will item sell price, their location, rarity, and seasonality! It will even display the time of day if it is relevant. You'll see information displayed in cards with some basic information, but if you click on the card more detail will be displayed.

The technologies used are React, Redux, Next.js, and the Nookipedia API. I have my own API key and you'll need to get your own if you want to code this website. Here is the link to the API website for your convenience: [Nookipedia API](https://api.nookipedia.com/)

This project is a work in progress. So far this project is a proof of concept of being able to extract data from an API and render the information in a cute way. There are design flaws that need to be ironed out and more features to add. An issue that I'm having a problem with is the text sizing messing up some of the cards because of spacing issues.

For the near future, I want to add:

- Navbar
- Filter Options
- Pagination
- Clicking a card enhances the card and adds more almanac information
